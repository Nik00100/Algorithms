/*An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
Given an integer n, return the nth ugly number.
Example 1:
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
Example 2:
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

We can find that every subsequence is the ugly-sequence itself (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, â€¦) multiply 2, 3, 5.
Then we use similar merge method as merge sort, to get every ugly number from the three subsequence.
Every step we choose the smallest one, and move one step after,including nums with same value.*/

    public static int nthUglyNumber(int n) {
        int[] ugly = new int[n];
        ugly[0] = 1;
        int index2 = 0, index3 = 0, index5 = 0;
        int factor2 = 2, factor3 = 3, factor5 = 5;
        for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
            int min = Math.min(Math.min(factor2,factor3),factor5);
            ugly[i] = min;
            if(factor2 == min)
                factor2 = 2*ugly[++index2];
            if(factor3 == min)
                factor3 = 3*ugly[++index3];
            if(factor5 == min)
                factor5 = 5*ugly[++index5];
        }
        return ugly[n-1];
