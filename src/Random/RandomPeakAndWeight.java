/*528. Random Pick with Weight https://leetcode.com/problems/random-pick-with-weight/description/

You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers w where w[i] describes the weight of the ith index.
You need to implement the function pickIndex(), which randomly picks an index in the range [0, w.length - 1]
(inclusive) and returns it. The probability of picking an index i is w[i] / sum(w).

For example, if w = [1, 3], the probability of picking index 0 is 1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25 (i.e., 25%),
and the probability of picking index 1 is 3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75 (i.e., 75%).*/

        for(int i=1; i<w.length; ++i)
            w[i] += w[i-1];
        this.wSums = w;
    }

    public int pickIndex() {
        int len = wSums.length;

            if(wSums[mid] == idx)
