package Array_Greedy.ArrayMinInSortedArray;

/*Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times.
For example, the array nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] might become:
[4,5,6,7,0,1,4] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,4,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Given the sorted rotated array nums that may contain duplicates, return the minimum element of this array.
You must decrease the overall operation steps as much as possible.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,5]
Output: 1
Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0*/
